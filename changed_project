# This is more of a statement of purpose, the professor and I decided to change 
#my final project to use some spatial data instead to determine species range and
# how these ranges could change due to climate change, I decided to concentrate 
# on mammals and obatin the maps from IUCN but I have no idea how I'm going to 
#download them much less extract their spatial data
